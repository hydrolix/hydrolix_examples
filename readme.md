This set of projects was created in order to provide various examples of how to work with Hydrolix.

Each example provides ample instructions on how to use.

So far, we've built out:

(1) A Getting Started Guide with NGINX web access logs (there is an associated Getting Started blog on hydrolix.io )
(2) Sample transforms for:
         (a) NGINX web access logs
         (b) Apache web access logs
         (c) Netflow logs

More to come!
